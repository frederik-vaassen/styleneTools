	INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

This repository contains wrappers and tools to use with Stylene, the JAVA-based
instance generation package. Since Stylene is still under active development,
these scripts may break or become irrelevant at any time.

The code is provided without warranty, meaning that we cannot guarantee that
they will function properly and that we cannot be held responsible if something
goes wrong. We might not always be able to provide support, but in most cases
the author(s) of the script will be happy to hear your comments, feedback or
questions.

Contact details for individual script authors can be found inside each script.
More general questions and remarks can be sent to Frederik Vaassen
(frederik.vaassen@ua.ac.be).

-------------------------
	styleneFolding.py
-------------------------

Pre-requisites:
-------------------------
- Python 2.6+
- a recent version of Stylene (version 2012/03/04 or newer). Specify the
location of Stylene at the top of the script.
- startparameters.xml containing the configuration you want to use for Stylene

Input:
-------------------------
- a directory containing your data set structured in the following way:

	[data_folder]
		\_ fold-01
			\_ [classA]
				\_ [doc1a.txt]
				\_ [doc2a.txt]
				\_ ...
			\_ [classB]
				\_ ...
			\_ ...
		\_ fold-02
			\_ [classA]
				\_ [doc1b.txt]
				\_ [doc2b.txt]
				\_ ...
			\_ [classB]
			\_ ...
		\_ ...

Folders and documents can take any name, EXCEPT the "fold-XX" folders, which
should respect the "fold-\d+" pattern.
- The individual documents should be Stylene-ready, i.e. one token per line,
tab-separated columns.

Output:
-------------------------
- The script will create train and test folds to use in n-fold cross-validation
experiments. The value of n depends on the number of fold-XX directories in the
data folder.
- The script will call Stylene for each train/test pair, and will retrieve the
generated instance files. These files will be stores in the "instances"
directory unless otherwise specified (see "Usage").


Usage:
-------------------------
$ python styleneFolding.py data_folder (options)

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --out-folder=OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Specify the output folder in which the instances will
                        be stored. (Default: in 'instances')
  -l LOG_FILE, --log-file=LOG_FILE
                        Specify the location of the log file where output and
                        errors will be written. (Default: stylene.log in the
                        working directory.)
  -d, --debug           Use this option for a much more verbose log.
